# 2022 Internship
This repository was used under my internship (2022). The repository contains around 4/5 different applications to get comfortable in c#.
And then a last one which I did as my final project there (which is the one listed below)

## System description
We love lunch, but it's not easy to find the right restaurant each day. A simple tool would be nice to help us select which restaurant to visit. It should be able to add new restaurants with information such as what food they serve (chinese, swedish, pizza etc.), where the restaurant is located, and it's opening hours. A randomising function can be used to select "the restaurant of the day", but make sure we don't get the same one too often!

## Instructions
* Fork this repository
* Make an estimate on how long you think it would take to complete this project and add it to the README
* Use .NET 6 for your system
* Include instructions on how to run your project in this README
* Spend approximately 4-6 hours on this project
* When you're done, write a little bit about what your next steps would be if you had more time
