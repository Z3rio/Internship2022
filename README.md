# Pre-interview assignment


## System description
We love lunch, but it's not easy to find the right restaurant each day. A simple tool would be nice to help us select which restaurant to visit. It should be able to add new restaurants with information such as what food they serve (chinese, swedish, pizza etc.), where the restaurant is located, and it's opening hours. A randomising function can be used to select "the restaurant of the day", but make sure we don't get the same one too often!
